## 🌟 About Me

I’m a full‑stack developer with a passion for turning **complex problems into simple, delightful user experiences**. Over the last 9+ years, I’ve built healthcare platforms, automotive dealer systems, and enterprise dashboards that scale. I love working with **React**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, and modern backend stacks — and I get a kick out of making apps fast, secure, and accessible.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech trends, experimenting with AI integrations, or mentoring budding developers.
